# The UMPGGK's tournament server

The UMPGGK is a series of tournaments, in which students, phd, assistants and professors can compete by implementing
the best AI player that plays a particular logic game.

### The instruction

To run the server (and the web app as well) use:
```
cd server
npm install // required, only if you haven't done that already
./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install // required, only if you haven't done that already
node ./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install // optional for windows
node server.js
```
Those commands should run the server on the port 6789 (default, can be changed in the config file)
and the web app on the port 8000 (default).

### The 2017 edition

In the 2017 edition, NoGo is the game, see details on the tournament site [here](http://ii.us.edu.pl/umpggk2017/).
